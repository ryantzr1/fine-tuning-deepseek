# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models

This repository is dedicated to a series on fine-tuning large language models. The series aims to provide a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to fine-tune models for specific tasks using various techniques and tools. The focus will be on practical implementations and insights derived from real-world use cases.

## What is PEFT?

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is an approach designed to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters instead of the entire model. This makes the process more computationally efficient and faster while still achieving high performance.

## Why Use PEFT?

Imagine you have a large, pre-trained language model like GPT-3, which has billions of parameters. Fine-tuning all these parameters for a new task, like sentiment analysis, would require enormous computational resources and time. PEFT techniques help by allowing you to fine-tune only a small fraction of these parameters, making the process more feasible.

## Key Techniques in PEFT

1. **LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation)**:
   - **Concept**: LoRa involves adding low-rank matrices to the model's weights. This means instead of modifying the entire weight matrix, you add smaller matrices that capture the necessary adjustments.
   - **Example**: Think of it like updating a massive library by only adding a few new shelves (low-rank matrices) rather than rearranging all the books (full model weights). These new shelves can capture the new information efficiently.

2. **Adapter Layers**:
   - **Concept**: Adapter layers are small neural network layers inserted within the larger model. Only these small layers are trained, while the rest of the model remains unchanged.
   - **Example**: Imagine you have a complex factory machine (the pre-trained model). Instead of overhauling the entire machine for a new product, you just add a small, specialized module (adapter layer) to handle the new task.

3. **Quantization**:
   - **Concept**: Quantization reduces the precision of the model’s weights and activations, typically from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers. This reduces the model size and computational requirements without significantly impacting performance.
  
## Example: Fine-Tuning Deepseek for Better Mathematical Abilities

Now, let's discuss the specific example we will be studying: fine-tuning the Deepseek model to enhance its mathematical problem-solving abilities. This task is part of an ongoing Kaggle competition focused on improving AI capabilities in solving complex math problems.

### The Challenge: AI Mathematical Olympiad

The [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize) involves adapting a pre-trained language model, Deepseek, to perform better at solving mathematical problems. Participants are required to fine-tune the model using a dataset of mathematical questions and answers. The goal is to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency in solving these problems.

### Approach

1. **Dataset Preparation**: We will use a dataset comprising a wide range of mathematical problems, including algebra, calculus, and geometry. This dataset will serve as the training data for fine-tuning Deepseek.

2. **Fine-Tuning with LoRa**:
   - **Adding Low-Rank Matrices**: Introduce low-rank matrices to Deepseek’s weights. These matrices will allow the model to adapt specifically to mathematical problem-solving.
   - **Training**: Fine-tune only the low-rank matrices on the mathematical problems dataset. This selective adjustment enables the model to learn efficiently without modifying its entire architecture.

3. **Quantization for Deployment**:
   - **Model Quantization**: Convert the fine-tuned model’s weights from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers. This step will make the model more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational requirements.
   - **Deployment**: The quantized model will be tested and deployed in the competition environment to ensure it performs well under resource constraints.

### Benefits of this Approach

- **Efficiency**: Fine-tuning only the low-rank matrices reduces computational costs and speeds up the training process.
- **Scalability**: Quantizing the model makes it feasible to deploy on devices with limited resources.
- **Performance**: The combined use of LoRa and Quantization allows the model to maintain high performance while being resource-efficient.

By applying these PEFT techniques, we aim to significantly improve Deepseek's ability to solve mathematical problems, making it a strong contender in the Kaggle competition. This example not only demonstrates the practical application of PEFT but also showcases its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
